# glucose data visualizer
an app to visualize my bf's glucose levels ! bc he's got diabetes o.o

first time using python+streamlit for a personal data app.

for now, i just want to take all the data sets i've collected and make a dashboard for them.

i'll likely add more functions, break up the data into separate sets, and add custom styling.
